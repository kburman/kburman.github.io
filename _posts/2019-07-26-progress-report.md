Hi,

For since my last post I have made some progress. I have decided to start with a desktop app. Started with an electron-react boilerplate. 
Could have chosen any other JS framework but I'm worked with react in past so quite comfortable with it. For those who think to say the Vue word. Please don't. Thanks

Would share more details about and it's how I'm planning to make it.

Screenshot of how it's looking right now.

I would say it look cooler than I anticipated but still this is not the direction I want to take this app into. I would like it to be multi-window or tabs.

UX is the main focus of mine. UI could be compromised by not UX.
