Today while browsing hacker-news I found a new hobby OS. [link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21860713)


I too have tried writing OS from scratch but lost the interest mid-way. I wanted a GUI system in my OS but that required too many things to do before and I was kind of lost where I couldn't find much motivation to continue. So I left it there and never got time to start it again.

But today I have a hobby OS which has a GUI ready to start with. What got my motivation kicked in that it is written in Crystal. Since I'm working on ruby as my day-to-day job I can easily jump in crystal.

More of all I was looking for a side project to kill my free time.  So It might be an excuse but I'm excited about it. Let's see how far can take this.
