Hello everyone,

This weekend I have started working on a new side-project. I'm calling it's `jekyll-editor` for now.
The idea behind this is to make the content creation process easy like wordpress with jekyll. I know jekyll is so easy to work with but it fails at so many steps. Like there's no easy way for me to add a simple image without going through a couple of blogs and tutorial. How about adding a graph like ipython or simple flow chart. It requires a lot of setups.
Even a simple thing like preview how it going to look like is hard. 

I have seen `jekyll-admin` and it is an awesome tool but I still feel it lacks UX. Jekyll promotes that it is so simple that everyone can start but the reality is that you need to get your hands dirty with terminal if want a jekyll blog up and running. I wish to solve this problem.
I know this is not going to solve all the problem but I'm thinking of at least making jekyll easy for the newcomers.
